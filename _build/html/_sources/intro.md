## Dionysian `Encode` 1, 2, 3
- I've listened to a lot of music in my 44 years. I studied music in school through to my A-levels. It's been a lifetime journey, including my time in a boy-band in my teens (Heaven Bound). Despite this, I failed to digest this music and felt musically constipated for nearly half a century.

## Sing O Muse `Code` 4
- Then came Vaughn Braithwaithe of Gospel Music University. He codified the essence of music for me, providing symbols and vocabulary 12 months ago (summer of 2023). Although I devoutly attended my scheduled calls only for the first few weeks of summer 2023, I've been overwhelmed with the various nutrients I'm accessing for the first time in my life. Music that wasn't digested is now breaking down into its essential fatty acids, glycerol, amino acids, sugars, etc.

## Apollonian `Decode` 5, 6
- The nutritional experience of these 12 months has been unbelievable. I "hear" music from my memory better and can rush to the piano to decode it instantly, usually in the key of Gb Major or Eb minor. This new key has revealed to me that the sweetest melodies and motifs are essentially pentatonic. In brief, I'm now able to encode all the music I've listened to, not only Gospel but even Bach! I'm finally finding a kindred spirit in Bach. Vaughn Braithwaithe will appraise my year at his university today.
