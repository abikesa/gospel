Hey Vaughn, with my subscription for 1-on-1s expiring soon, I just had a thought. I only had regular 1-on-1 sessions between July and October last year. Due to increasing time constraints, Lorenzo and I agreed to schedule sessions as needed rather than every Monday. Our last session was on October 23, 2023.
Between October and April, Lorenzo reached out on April 20 with concern over my lack of scheduled meetings. He wrote:
"Hey Abi, how are you doing? Long time no see! How’s the practice going and what are you working on? Which questions do you have for me? Remember, I’m here to support you and help you in this journey, so if you have anything I can give feedback on, I’ll be happy to do it :)"
Since I haven’t used any tutor time or attended group sessions for the last 8 months, I kindly request an 8-month extension. I could resume regular 1-on-1s starting October, once my work situation stabilizes.
I would appreciate your consideration. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.


Hi Abi,
Thank you for reaching out!
I understand how life can get incredibly busy, and I appreciate your commitment to improving your piano skills despite your hectic schedule. Our 12-month contract guarantees support and access to our resources for that duration from the start date.
Think of it like a gym membership – if you don’t attend regularly, the gym can’t extend your membership for free, as they have reserved space and resources for you during that time. Similarly, we have dedicated time and resources for each student based on their contracted enrollment period.
We offer multiple ways to support our students, including:
- Scheduling for 1on1 sessions
- Direct messaging for questions
- Asynchronous video submissions for personal playing feedback
- Access to recordings of coaching calls
- And more!
While we wish we could accommodate every individual circumstance, adjusting our policy for work/personal scheduling conflicts would be unfair to other students who adhere to the same terms.
Thank you for your understanding, and I encourage you to make the most of the resources still available to you. We're here to help you succeed within the contracted period.
Best regards,
Vaughn
